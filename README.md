This was made in adobe animate using the frame picker tool 

hell this might act as a little tutorial too for people who were just as confused as me.
First you draw your mouth shape press F8 to convert it into a symbol (make sure it's a graphic) 
and double click to go into the symbol, and inside of the symbol make sure to press F7 to draw all of the other mouth shapes.
Once you are done exit out of the symbol and go to properties. 
and then click onto the symbol and you must get an option to let you use frame picker.
P.S MAKE SURE THAT IT IS SET TO SINGLE FRAME IN THE OPTIONS AND NOT LOOPING.
I hoped this helped. :)
